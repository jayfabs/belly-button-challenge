# belly-button-challenge
 
This module challenge was set from Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp.
Visual of the dashboard can be seen at https://jayfabs.github.io

This challenged used the bootstrap javascript library to create a visual dashboard of bateria test data given to me from the project. There is also a drop down menue that can be used to parse through each test subject.
